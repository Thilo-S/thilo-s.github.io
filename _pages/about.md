I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Previous to that I did a BSc in Physics at the University of Bonn and the Master's in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics at the University of Oxford.

Research interest

I am currently working on Quantum Information and Quantum Computing and am thinking a lot about fundamental open questions in physics from this perspective.
